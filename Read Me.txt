ABSTRACT:

 Agriculture is the essence that keeps us alive and is the Back bone of Indian Economy. Hence it is crucial to protect
 it from several evils surmounting it. The Farmers in India don't get their justifiable/reasonable rates for the goods they
 produce in farming.Their goods are bought by distributors and manufacturers at much lower rates and sold to public
 with higher rates. In this case, only the distributors get more profit, while both the Farmer and the customer end up in agony.
 As a result of this, The Farmers in India leave Agriculture and choose some other Profession for their Livelihood.
 In our project “E-Retailing of agricultural products” we introduce farmers into a common e-commerce website and
 make them fix prices for their product, so that they can sell them directly to public.By having them on this website we
 can make local farmer's market to be known worldwide. In this way the farmers get justifiable rates for their products and
 earn good profit. By implementing it we can improve the farmer's economic level and also it is good for the public as they
 make obvious pay for their purchase. Our project provides an easy interface for the farmers to add their products and also
 fix price for it. On the user front, customers can navigate to their desired product through categories and select a desired product
 along with the quantity.
